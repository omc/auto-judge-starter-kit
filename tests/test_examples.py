"""Smoke tests for the judges defined in this repo.

Judges are discovered dynamically (git-tracked judges/*/workflow.yml), so this test
never goes stale when judges are added or removed — every judge repo inherits it
unchanged, no per-fork customization needed (same discovery as test_endpoint_contract
and test_workflow_consistency). Example-judge-specific assertions belong in that judge's
own tests, not here, so a fork that deletes the examples keeps a passing suite.
